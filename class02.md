# Components Life Cycle - Props & State
Components are very important since the process of UI rendering goes through them by having somethings called Life Cycle events which are methods called during the life cycle of the component.
Props and state are one of the most important topics in React since they are used to pass and update data and elements.
As for props it is used to pass the data to the component to be renderd, meanwhile the state is built inside of the component and it used in there to keep the data passed updated.
