# More CRUD

CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.Think of CRUD as a simple concept that represents the four basic functions that models should be able to do and are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application. In simpler terms, it represents the four basic operations you can do on any data. You can create something new, read or view the newly created data, edit or update the data and finally the option to delete it.

1. **What's the relationship between REST and CRUD?**
REST has the foundation of RESTful architecture that supports HTTP for the web interface, whereas CRUD can be mapped to DDS, SQL, or HTTP methods,
REST is a paradigm of building web services by exposing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) semantics on HTTP protocol using POST, GET, PUT, DELETE respectively.


2. **If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**

a. create your server 
b. create your CRUD routes so you can access data in your database.
c. create the database and give it initial data.
d. now you will have to make your frontend app to render the data and functionalize it.
f. Documentation.
