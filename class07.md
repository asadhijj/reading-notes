# REST

REST (Representational State Transfer) is important due to its simplicity and the fact that it builds upon existing systems and features of the internet's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) in order to achieve its objectives, as opposed to creating new standards, frameworks and technologies.

## HTTP PROTOCOL

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. **Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. **What does a GET do?**
The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed.

5. **What does a POST do?**
it allows a system to add something to another system

6. **What does PUT do?**
it allows a system to replace something in another system

7. **What does PATCH do?**
allows system to do a partial update in another system.
