# Stacks And Queues

## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

Basic Operations of Stack

* Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
* Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
* IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
* IsFull: Check if the stack is full
* Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it Stack

**Applications of Stack**

   * Stack is used for evaluating expression with operands and operations.
   * Matching tags in HTML and XML
   * Undo function in any text editor.
   * Infix to Postfix conversion.
   * Stacks are used for backtracking and parenthesis matching.
   * Stacks are used for conversion of one arithmetic notation to another arithmetic notation.
   * Stacks are useful for function calls, storing the activation records and deleting them after returning from the function. It is very useful in processing the function calls.
   * Stacks help in reversing any set of data or strings.

## Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO). This means the first element inserted inside the queue is removed first.

**Basic Operations of Queue**

   * Enqueue: Add an element to the end of a queue
   * Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of a queue
   * IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
   * IsFull: Check if the queue is full
   * Peek: Get the value of the front element without removing it Queue

## FIFO & LILO and LIFO & FILO Principles:

Queue: First In First Out (FIFO): The first object into a queue is the first object to leave the queue, used by a queue.
Stack: Last In First Out (LIFO): The last object into a stack is the first object to leave the stack, used by a stack

OR

Stack: First In Last Out (FILO): The first object or item in a stack is the last object or item to leave the stack.
Queue: Last In Last Out (LILO): The last object or item in a queue is the last object or item to leave the queue.

**Applications of Queue**

   * Queue is used when things donâ€™t have to be processed immediately, but have to be processed in First InFirst Out order like Breadth First Search.
   * Queue is also used when a resource is shared among multiple consumers. Examples include CPU scheduling, Disk Scheduling.
   * When data is transferred asynchronously (data not necessarily received at same rate as sent) between two processes.  
   *  xamples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.
