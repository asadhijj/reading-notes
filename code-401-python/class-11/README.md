# Data Visualization

In today’s world, a lot of data is being generated on a daily basis. And sometimes to analyze this data for certain trends, patterns may become difficult if the data is in its raw format. To overcome this data visualization comes into play. Data visualization provides a good, organized pictorial representation of the data which makes it easier to understand, observe, analyze.

Python provides various libraries that come with different features for visualizing data. All these libraries come with different features and can support various types of graphs : 

* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Bokeh

## Matplotlib

**matplotlib** is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.
IPython

**IPython** is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.
pyplot

**pyplot** provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. 


## Seaborn 

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures.

Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.

Different questions are best answered by different plots. Seaborn makes it easy to switch between different visual representations by using a consistent dataset-oriented API.

**Seaborn and Matplolib**

Seaborn’s integration with matplotlib allows you to use it across the many environments that matplotlib supports, including exploratory analysis in notebooks, real-time interaction in GUI applications, and archival output in a number of raster and vector formats.

While you can be productive using only seaborn functions, full customization of your graphics will require some knowledge of matplotlib’s concepts and API. One aspect of the learning curve for new users of seaborn will be knowing when dropping down to the matplotlib layer is necessary to achieve a particular customization. On the other hand, users coming from matplotlib will find that much of their knowledge transfers.

Matplotlib has a comprehensive and powerful API; just about any attribute of the figure can be changed to your liking. A combination of seaborn’s high-level interface and matplotlib’s deep customizability will allow you both to quickly explore your data and to create graphics that can be tailored into a publication quality final product.

## Bokeh

Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. It is good for:

   * Interactive visualization in modern browsers
   * Standalone HTML documents, or server-backed apps
   * Expressive and versatile graphics
   * Large, dynamic or streaming data
   * Easy usage from python (or Scala, or R, or...)


Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.
