# DATA ANALYSIS

## Jupyter Lab

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities. such as text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters.

Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing.

JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.) and can also display rich kernel output in these formats
