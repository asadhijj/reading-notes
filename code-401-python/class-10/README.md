# Linear Regression 

Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning. There are many regression methods available. Linear regression is one of them.

Regression searches for relationships among variables. For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on their features, such as experience, education level, role, city of employment, and so on.

In other words, you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.

The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses. The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, regressors, or predictors.

Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent experience or gender impacts salaries.

Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors. For example, you could try to predict electricity consumption of a household for the next hour given the outdoor temperature, time of day, and number of residents in that household.


**Types of Linear Regression:**

   1. Simple Linear Regression
   2. Multiple Linear Regression
   3. Logistic regression
   4. Ordinal regression
   5. Multinomial regression
   6. Discriminant analysis

## Linear Regression with Python 


**There are five basic steps when you’re implementing linear regression:**

1. Import the packages and classes you need.
2. Provide data to work with and eventually do the regression.
3. Create a regression model and fit it with existing data.
4. Check the results of model fitting to know whether the model is satisfactory.
5. Apply the model for predictions.


**Train & Test Splits:**

* Overfitting means that model we trained has trained “too well” and is now, well, fit too closely to the training dataset. This usually happens when the model is too complex (i.e. too many features/variables compared to the number of observations). This model will be very accurate on the training data but will probably be very not accurate on untrained or new data.

* Underfitting means that the model does not fit the training data and therefore misses the trends in the data. It also means the model cannot be generalized to new data. As you probably guessed (or figured out!), this is usually the result of a very simple model (not enough predictors/independent variables).
