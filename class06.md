# Node JS

Node JS is another important framework that is used with javascript since it has high speed performence and allows the developer to run their apps on different web browsers and it is responsible for compiling the code into your machine local code that the computer can excute it so it is basically JavaScript runtime.

*** 

## Node JS Discussion :

1. **What is node.js?**
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

2. **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?** 
it is an open source JavaScript engine that has high performence which compile JavaScript to optimized local machine code before excution.

3. **What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**
by saying Javascript run time it is meant that the time taken to run a javascript code is the same time of compiling that code into a local machine language for excution.

4. **What is npm?**
it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

5. **What version of node are you running on your machine?** 
v16.16.0

6. **What version of npm are you running on your machine?**
8.11.0

7. **What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**
npm install -g jshint

8. **What is node used for?**
 installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

 ## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

 1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

 A. Greater Efficiency
 B. Engaged Collaboration
 C. Learning from fellow students
 D. Social Skills
 E. Job Interviews Readiness
 F. Work Enviornment Readiness


 2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
 in my humble opinion i think the most benficial reasons are being able to learn from fellow students, Work environemt rediness and the Greater efficiency since different people are better in different stuff which makes the process better.

 3. **How does pair programming work?** 
  [@https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/]
  pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
